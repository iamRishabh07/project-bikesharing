<h1>Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns</h1>

## Project Overview

In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I have also got to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems.
